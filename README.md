# Push Swap

This is a sorting algorithm challenge from 42 school. The goal is to sort a stack of integers using only a limited set of stack operations, using as few moves as possible.

## ðŸ§  Project Goal

Implement a program that takes a list of integers and sorts them using two stacks (`a` and `b`) and a limited set of operations (`sa`, `pb`, `ra`, etc.). The goal is to produce the smallest number of instructions possible.
